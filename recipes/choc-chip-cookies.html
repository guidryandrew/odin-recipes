    <h2>Delicious Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies!</h2>
    <p>These super soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies are my favorite chocolate chip cookies.</p>
    <p>Melted butter, extra egg yolk, and more brown sugar than white sugar makes for a chewy texture.</p>
    <p>No mixer required!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room tempurature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no lumps remain.  
            Whisk in the egg, then the egg yolk.  Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract.  Pour the wet ingredients into the
            dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon.  Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Cover the doug and chill in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours. This is a must!</li>
        <li>Take dough out of the fridge and let soften up to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into balls, about 3 tablespoons each. Make them taller rather than wider.</li>
        <li>Place about 8 balls onto each baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes. They will look very soft. They will continue to cook on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
